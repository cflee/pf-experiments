## cpf-node

Experimenting with designing and evolving interfaces, and thinking about how "building blocks" might or might not work, using CPF contribution rate calculations as a toy topic.

I don't really know JavaScript or Node.js, the code is probably quite un-idiomatic.
I'm just doing this in JavaScript so that if it works out I can use it in the browser later, assuming it's possible to bridge this CommonJS and ES Modules abyss safely...

```
npm install

npm run test
```
